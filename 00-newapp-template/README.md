# Welcome!
Do you want to build a modern Go tool with a **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface (**CLI**) similar to Docker, Kubernetes, aws-cli, etc.?  ? Start here. :- ) 

This project is a starting set of Go files and directories. Simply 'Copy & Paste', 'Find & Replace', tweak a few default values and you can be up and running. 

This package has four major parts to it:
  1) Server - Implementation of all the ACME Services such as `/gophers`, `/gopher/1/things` (built using [`go-chi`](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) ) 
  2) ACME Services Library (`pkg.acme.Service`) for making the HTTP ACME API service calls to a server (`/gophers`)  
  3) Client - Uses the service library and converts ACME.Gophers (`pkg.acme.Gopher`) to Client.Gophers (`pkg.client.Gopher`) to produce `pkg.client.GopherThings`
  4) ... and a CLI invocation and configuration framework laid out with [`cobra`](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) and [`viper`](https://github.com/spf13/viper)

This code includes:
- [x] Fundamental Go features like tests, generate, templates, go routines, contexts, channels, OS signals, HTTP routing, build/run tags, ldflags, 
- [x] Uses [`cobra`](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) and [`viper`](https://github.com/spf13/viper) (without func inits!!!)
  - Cleanly separated CLI/configuration invocation from client library calls - by calling `viper.Unmarshal` to transfer our `pkg.Config`
  - **NOTE**: A lot of sample Cobra/Viper code rely on `func init()` making it more difficult to reuse. 
- [x] Using [`vfsgen`](https://github.com/shurcooL/vfsgen) in to embed templates into binary
    - The `config\template\*` contain all text output and is compiled into a `templates_generate.go` via [`vfsgen`](https://github.com/shurcooL/vfsgen) for the binary build
- [X] Logging from the [`logrus`](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) library
- [x] [Retry](https://github.com/matryer/try) using @matryer's idiomatic `try.Do(..)`
- [X] Instrumentation with [`prometheus`](https://prometheus.io/) in the server and client library
  - [Tutorials](https://pierrevincent.github.io/2017/12/prometheus-blog-series-part-4-instrumenting-code-in-go-and-java/)
- [X] HTTP serving/routing with middleware from [`go-chi`](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
    - Using `NewStructuredLogger` middleware to decorate each route with log output
    - `ResponseHandler` to pretty print JSON with [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
    - Custom middlewares (`GopherCtx`,`ThingCtx`) to handle creating Context from HTTP requests
- [x] An example Dockerfile and build recipe `(docs/recipe/)` for a docker workflow
  - Use `docker build --tag gophercli:v1 .` to create a full golang image
  - Use `docker run -it --rm gophercli:v1` to work from with the container

I've [curated a YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa1qVAzg1FHthbIaRRbLyA4sNE4PmLmn6) of videos which help explain how I ended up with this structure and 'why things are the way they are.' I've leveraged 'best practices' I've seen and that have been explicted called out by others. Of course **THERE ARE SOME WRINKLES** and few **PURELY DEMONSTRATION** portions of code. I hope to be able to keep improving on this.

# Go version 1.11 or greater required!
A lot has happened in the Go ecosystem in the last year two-years. As a result this project is:
- Using go modules proper (ie. `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `vendor` folder) 
  - Works outside of `$GOPATH`
  - `go test -v ./...` demostrating server start / stop, add/update/delete gopher and things. 
  - `go build -tags release cmd\gophercli.go` to build an executable with templates embedded in the binary
  - 'Hermetic build/run/test' with `vendor` folder checked-in 
  - **NOTE:** still need `GOFLAGS="-mod=vendor"` until Go 1.12

# The Story of 00-newapp-template
There is a vendor named ACME who provides API to access to `Gophers` and `Things`. Because I use the ACME API **all the time** to track `Gophers` and their `Things` and I have decided to create a CLI tool to perform the HTTP API calls needed and output a text table or JSON structure. Ideally using a simple command like:
```
  ./gophercli list 
```
The client would make all the necessary calls to the HTTP ACME services, convert the JSON responses to Go structures and output something like:
```

| 2   |Gopher2   |The second Gopher (#2nd)      | 6   | Feet       |Shoes      |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
## The Challenge: ACME Data Types
At ACME each `Thing` has a `Gopher` but each `Gopher` does not have `Things`. That means given a `Gopher` we don't know their collection of `Things`. Also, given a `Thing` we only have the associated `GopherID` and not the `Gopher` `Name` or `Gopher` `Description`. 
```
  package acme
  type Gopher struct {
    ID          json.Number `json:"gopher_id"`
    Name        string      `json:"name"`
    Description string      `json:"description"`
  }

  type Thing struct {
    ID          json.Number `json:"thing_id"`
    GopherID    json.Number `json:"gopher_id"`
    Name        string      `json:"name"`
    Description string      `json:"description"`
  }
```
These JSON structures are defined in `pkg\acme\json.go` and are what the ACME HTTP API return.

While ACME's data structure and JSON schema is useful for their purposes - it's incomplete for our application's needs. A much more useful structure for our application (listing `Gophers` and their `Things`) looks like this:
```
  package adapter
  type Gopher struct {
    ID          string           `json:"id"`
    Name        string           `json:"name"`
    Description string           `json:"description"`
    Things      map[string]Thing `json:"things"`
  }

  type Thing struct {
    Gopher      Gopher `json:"gopher"`
    ID          string `json:"id"`
    Name        string `json:"name"`
    Description string `json:"description"`
  }
```
Here each `Gopher` has a collection of their `Things` and each `Thing` has a reference to a complete `Gopher` (not just the `Gopher` `ID`.)

## The Solution - Build an adapter!
We will write a client library to make ACME HTTP service calls, unmarshal the JSON, filter and convert it into our Go structures. All of this adapter code is in the `pkg\adapter\` folder. 

Our adapter uses services provide by ACME as defined in the `pkg\acme\service.go` file.

Because ACME API charges us per API call, we decided to mock implement our own ACME HTTP API server. Our server will listen for connections on local host and respond just like an ACME server would. All the code to provide a full HTTP API server is in `pkg\acme\server\` and to invoke our ACME server:
```
  ./gophercli server start
```
